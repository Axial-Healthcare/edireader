# edireader
EDIReader is a Java package for parsing business documents structured according to EDI standards. It supports the SAX and JAXP interfaces defined for XML, making it suitable for use in any XML-based system that allows the configuration of a custom SAX parser.

This repository is created by the owner/creator of the EDIReader project orignally hosted at SourgeForge. Initially, this repository will be simply a copy of the most recent release of the project at SourceForge, 4.7.3, structured as a Maven project. It will then be updated with later versions of these Java classes drawn from the current commercial verson of EDIReader, which has been and will continue to be available under a commercial license bundled with a number of other packages adding additional features.

The hope is for EDIReader to become available in Maven Central Repository.
